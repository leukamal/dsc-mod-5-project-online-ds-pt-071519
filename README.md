Flight delays are most of the time very frustrating to passengers and costly to airline companies. Flight delays are not easy to understand as they arise from multiple reasons like increase in air traffic at the origin or destination airport, weather etc. The arrival delay data of a few airline carrier could be useful to understand some causes of flight delays.

The goal of this project is to construct a flight delay prediction model leveraging flight On-Time performance data and use the model for deriving insights about past flight delays. The on-time arrival data for non-stop domestic flights from US Department of Transportation(DoT) was used for this analysis.
